## The Story


### Disclaimer
It's just a funny story - not intended to be offensive or insulting any one or group.

I Do respect all of the users.

if in the course of story, you fill uncomfortable, please skip the **story** and got to the next section cause I dont want to make you sad.

### Intro دیباچه
A lot of people starting with a **Hello World!**. That exclamation mark matters,so an starting point.

it doesn't matter if whose gonna take the responsibilty. a console.log, print, printf, cout<< ,echo ....

it will make a bound between the *noobi* and the *words* he is commanding so.

these words aitn ordinary words, they are are magical. they make somesthing to happen.

so after a while the noob got addicted to these words and the **language** which cause this magical effect.

it's a kind a mushroom that nobody told you about its addiction.

after a while, s/he may turn into a vampier who is awake all the nights, coding for a little more data-blood to flow.

people usually call those vampier as a `geek`.

Mine was diffrent, cause I have started with an `onclick` using `actionScript` ...

### Logos λόγος

Whatever, the magic is within the words.

> In the beginning was the Logos, and the logos was with God, and the Logos was God. (John 1:1)

So this magic words was from the begining,

But at before The Industrial Ages, no one either john it self could not speak with `C` or even `assembly` 

These languages has been vanished from The Babylon,

Now, The God give the people another chance.

She sent them her **Dev** prophets, to rears the **lusers**.
