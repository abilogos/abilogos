Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">
I am an Analytical, Experienced & self-motivated Software Developer focusing on Webüï∏Ô∏è development. 

I have started web development when I was a university senior student using PHP since 2013.
However I have some experience with Java EE & ASP.NET, I prefer to use PHP for Back-end
Development. Although I am familiar with Node.js & Expressjs.

I have passions for learning & working with edge technologies and tools. I am seeing myself trying to discover how things works & how I can improve them.
I am good at speech and have persuasive character. 

<h3> &lt;/HelloWorld&gt;  </h3>
